##cheap raspberry pi based security system, paying homage to the innovative canary.io device

fun project with kids on a rainy saturday morning, but actually useful as a cheap internet security device.. 

silly prototype that also includes my 6 year olds "chip the robot" project board.. 
all components will fit in standard raspberry pi case...
